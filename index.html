      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I live my life a quarter mile at a...I can't, sorry. I'm thirty years old with a wife, and two children. My third child will be born during this boot camp. I'm transitioning from a career I've put twelve years into, and while I'm excited, I'm also terrified.</p>

      <p>Palmdale, CA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Computer gaming, being physically active, and keeping my tiny humans alive.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I don't know yet. There's too much about this industry I don't know about. Short term, I'd like to be a project manager.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Ahwatukee, Arizona</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My life has been centered around computers since I was nine. I've always wanted to be a programmer of some kind, and I feel web development is the best way for me to put my soft skills from my previous career to good use.</p>
